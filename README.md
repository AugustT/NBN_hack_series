# Getting Started:

Clone the project using RStudio and run the `setup.R` file. This will save your NBN credentials in the `NBN_Details.R` file (this is automatically ignored by Git to keep them private).

Run the Analysis.Rmd file in RStudio. This includes a basic analysis already to get you started.

# Troubleshooting

 * Make sure your R and RStudio installations are up-to-date
